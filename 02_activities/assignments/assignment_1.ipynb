    "In this assignment, you will be asked to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. At each step, you'll be guided through the process of developing a model architecture to solve a problem. Your goal is to create a CNN that attains at least 55% accuracy on the validation set.\n",

    "### The CIFAR-100 Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The [CIFAR-100 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 500 images from each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use Keras with TensorFlow to develop your CNN. For this assignment, it's strongly recommended that you use a GPU to accelerate your training, or else you might find it difficult to train your network in a reasonable amount of time. If you have a computer with a GPU that you wish to use, you can follow the [TensorFlow instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for installing TensorFlow with GPU support. Otherwise, you can use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to complete this assignment. Colab provides free access to GPU-enabled machines. If you run into any issues, please contact us as soon as possible so that we can help you resolve them.\n"

    "\n",
    "- Briefly discuss the results.\n",
    "- Did the model's performance improve?\n",
    "- Yes, the model's performance improved. The test accuracy increased from 36.64% to 40.77%, and there were improvements in precision, recall, and F1-score as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why do you think this is?\n",
    "- The improvement is likely due to data augmentation. By artificially increasing the diversity of the training data through transformations like rotations, shifts, flips, and zooms, the model learned to generalize better and became more robust to variations in the images, reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do you think there is room for further improvement? Why or why not?\n",
    "- there is room for further improvement. The current performance indicates that the model can still be enhanced. Techniques such as more sophisticated data augmentation, regularization methods like dropout and batch normalization, and fine-tuning the model architecture and hyperparameters could further boost performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What other techniques might you try in the future?\n",
    "- Dropout: To prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.\n",
    "- Learning Rate Schedulers: To adjust the learning rate dynamically.\n",
    "- Transfer Learning: Using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on CIFAR-100.\n",
